Utilities

.. module:: ae7qparser.utils

``ae7qparser.utils`` is a collection of utilities you may find helpful when using ``ae7qparser``.

Currently, the available utilities are:

* ``base_url``: the default base of the ae7q website URL. This will also direct you to the main page of ae7q.
* ``ca_pfx``: this is mostly designed for internal use, but it is a set of all Canadian callsign prefixes.
* ``{*_}colours``: these namespaces are the colours that ae7q uses to denote different statuses for database
  entries. See http://ae7q.com/query/text/Explain.php#Colors for more information.
